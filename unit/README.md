# Geometrize Haxe Unit Tests

This is the unit test suite for Geometrize Haxe. The intent is to achieve good test coverage of the codebase, and to add regression tests for fixed bugs.

The tests are run on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Tw1ddle/geometrize-haxe) and [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Tw1ddle/geometrize-haxe) CI.

## Setup

haxelib install munit
```

## Usage

Open and build the FlashDevelop project in this directory to run the tests.
